## 1. Elemental Words
- **KINETIC**: Constant movement of knowledge.
- **AUTHORITY**: The final word on research validation.
- **PRECISION**: Zero-noise extraction of insights.
- **LEGACY**: Building a corpus that transcends temporary trends.

## 2. The Persona
**The Sovereign Arbitrageur**
He doesn't just read papers; he harvests them for edge. He views information as a fluid asset class. He needs a tool that is as sharp as a scalpel and as powerful as a supercollider.

## 3. Visual Identity (AKSHON UI)
### Color Palette (The "Looming Wealth" Scheme)
- **Deep Obsidian** (`#050505`): The void from which insights emerge.

- **Electric Cobalt** (`#2E5BFF`): The spark of connection.
- **Glassmorphic Slate** (`#1A1A1A`): The layers of context.

### Design Principles
1. **Depth over Flatness**: Use Z-axis animations and layers to signify the depth of research.

3. **Information Density**: High-value data front and center, but with "clutter-free" execution.
4. **The Pulse**: A subtle, periodic glow in the background indicating "Live Aggregation".

## 4. Brand Tone
- **Voice**: Calculated, Forward-leaning, Ruthless on accuracy.
- **Tagline**: "Actionable Intelligence at the Speed of Thought."
